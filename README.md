# Lung-Health-Detection

Hiii, I am Ashish Final Year student of Computer Engineering.

For this web Application You have to pre-installed Django, Tensorflow and some basic Python Libraries.

I have created 1 Web application on which user can sign-up and sign-in with gmail and provide x-ray image of lung to predict that that image has chances to covid or not and it will show result that this image type is Covid/Normal and Covid Image Chances and Normal Image Chances.

To Prediction I have Train a CNN Model and saved it for predection that model name is "bestmodel.h5".

This site made in Django so if any programmer want to access Admin panel then they have to create superuser for it.

Thank You.
